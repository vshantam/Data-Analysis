# Data-Analysis
## Introduction
This repository will be used to analyse different datasets and to derive some insights and meaning.<br>
As we know the data is very important and playing the crucial role in the growing industry such as google,microsoft,amazon etc.
so,it is really important for how to understand the data.

# Big data
![alt_tag](http://www.pcquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/yourstory_BigData.jpg)

Big data is data sets that are so voluminous and complex that traditional data-processing application software are inadequate to deal with them.<br>
To understand the real complex scenario it is important to understand the depth of  the data and for that we use data analysis techniques.

# Folder Structure

    1.Data Analysis(Folder)
      
      --- folder of on which the analysis is being done.
      --- Analysis # where all the analysis chart will be stored.
      --- Code # which is used in the analysis.
      --- Dataset # folder that contains dataset.
      --- Spec # folder that contains the dependencies.
      
# Analysis on  
1.Match dataset :"https://github.com/vshantam/Data-Analysis/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Match/Dataset/Match.csv"
2.Bitcoin dataset :"https://www.quandl.com/data/BITCOINWATCH-Bitcoin-Watch"

# Insights generated and overview.
 ### 1.Match datset : [Go to analysis file](./analysismatch.MD)
 ### 1.Bitcoin dataset : [Go to analysis file](./analysisbitcoin.MD)

<b>Note:</b>This project is still under development.Later i will be providing the link to the dataset.
